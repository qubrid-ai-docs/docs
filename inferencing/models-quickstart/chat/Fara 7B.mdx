## About the Provider
Microsoft is a global technology company and AI platform provider, building large-scale AI systems, research models, and developer tools. Through Microsoft Research and its cloud ecosystem, the company supports open and enterprise AI development across productivity, cloud, and intelligent agent technologies

## Model Quickstart

This section helps you quickly get started with the `microsoft/Fara-7B` model on the Qubrid AI inferencing platform.

To use this model, you need:

- A valid **Qubrid API key**
- Access to the Qubrid inference API
- Basic knowledge of making API requests in your preferred language

Once authenticated with your API key, you can send inference requests to the `microsoft/Fara-7B` model and receive responses based on your input prompts.

Below are example placeholders showing how the model can be accessed using different programming environments.  
You can choose the one that best fits your workflow.

## Model Overview

**Fara 7B** is a Computer Use Agent (CUA) model designed to take actions on the web to complete user goals.
It operates by understanding browser screenshots, tracking previous actions, and deciding the next action required to move toward a task.
The model predicts actions step-by-step instead of generating only text.

### When to use?

You should consider using **Fara 7B** if:

- You are building browser-based automation
- You need an agent that can take actions, not just generate text
- Your workflow relies on screenshots + action history
- You want step-by-step execution of user goals

### Inference Parameters
| Parameter Name | Type    | Default | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Streaming      | boolean | true    | Enable streaming responses for real-time output.                            |
| Temperature    | number  | 0.7     | Controls creativity and randomness; higher values produce more diverse output. |
| Max Tokens     | number  | 4096    | Maximum number of tokens the model can generate.                            |
| Top P          | number  | 1       | Nucleus sampling that restricts token selection to a probability mass threshold. |

### Key Features

- **Computer Use Agent (CUA) :**
  Designed to take actions on the web to accomplish high-level user tasks.
- **Multimodal Input :**
  Uses browser screenshots along with text and action history to decide next steps.
- **Step-by-Step Action Execution :**
  Predicts actions with grounded arguments such as coordinates for clicks.
- **On-Device Execution :**
  Provides privacy guarantees and lower latency.

### Execution Constraints

The model stops execution at critical points, including:
