## Inference Parameters
| Parameter Name | Type    | Default | Description                                                                        |
| -------------- | ------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Streaming      | boolean | true    | Enable streaming responses for real-time output.                                   |
| Temperature    | number  | 0.7     | Controls randomness. Higher values mean more creative but less predictable output. |
| Max Tokens     | number  | 4096    | Defines the maximum number of tokens the model is allowed to generate.             |
| Top P          | number  | 0.9     | Nucleus sampling that limits token selection to a subset of top probability mass.  |

## Key Features
1. High-quality reasoning and instruction adherence
2. Strong performance on code and analytical tasks
3. Large context window for long-document processing
4. Open-weight model suitable for private and on-prem deployments
