## About the Provider 
**OpenAI** is the organization behind GPT OSS 120B. They are a major AI research lab and platform provider known for creating influential generative AI models (like the GPT series). With GPT-OSS, OpenAI is extending its technology into the open-source ecosystem, empowering developers and enterprises to run powerful language models without proprietary restrictions.

## Model Quickstart

This section helps you quickly get started with the `openai/gpt-oss-120b` model on the Qubrid AI inferencing platform.

To use this model, you need:

- A valid **Qubrid API key**
- Access to the Qubrid inference API
- Basic knowledge of making API requests in your preferred language

Once authenticated with your API key, you can send inference requests to the `openai/gpt-oss-120b` model and receive responses based on your input prompts.

Below are example placeholders showing how the model can be accessed using different programming environments.  
You can choose the one that best fits your workflow.

This will produce the response below:

**Quantum Computing in Plain English**

### 1. The ordinary computer you already know  
- **Bits** are the tiny switches inside a laptop or phone.  
- Each bit is either **0** *or* **1** (think of a light that's either off or on).  
- By wiring billions of bits together and flipping them in clever patterns, we can do calculations, run games, browse the web, etc.

### 2. The "quantum" twist  
A quantum computer uses **qubits** (quantum bits) instead of ordinary bits...

To access just the chain-of-thought reasoning you can look at the `reasoning` property:

```plain theme={null}
We need to respond with an explanation of quantum computing. The system messages: we are ChatGPT, we have to follow policies. There's no disallowed content. Provide a clear, thorough explanation, possibly with analogies, basics of qubits, superposition, entanglement, quantum gates, algorithms, challenges, current state, future. Should be accessible but also technical. Use headings. Possibly ask follow-up. Provide references. Ensure no copyrighted text. Provide original content. Let's produce a comprehensive answer.
