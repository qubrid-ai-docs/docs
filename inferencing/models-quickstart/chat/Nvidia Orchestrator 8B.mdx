## Model Quickstart

This section helps you quickly get started with the `nvidia/Orchestrator-8B` model on the Qubrid AI inferencing platform.

To use this model, you need:
- A valid **Qubrid API key**
- Access to the Qubrid inference API
- Basic knowledge of making API requests in your preferred language

Once authenticated with your API key, you can send inference requests to the `nvidia/Orchestrator-8B` model and receive responses based on your input prompts.

Below are example placeholders showing how the model can be accessed using different programming environments.  
You can choose the one that best fits your workflow.

### Key Features
- **Intelligent Orchestration**
Capable of managing heterogeneous toolsets, including basic tools such as search and code execution, as well as other LLMs (both specialized and generalist).
- **Efficiency**
Delivers higher accuracy at significantly lower computational cost compared to monolithic frontier models
- **Robust Generalization**
Demonstrates the ability to generalize to unseen tools and pricing configurations.

### Benchmark Performance
- Achieves 37.1% on the Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE) benchmark
- Outperforms:GPT-5 , Claude Opus 4.1 , Qwen3-235B-A22B

### Limitations
- **Scalability**
The model has not been tested at larger sizes (greater than 8B parameters), and it is unclear whether performance and efficiency advantages would persist at that scale.

- **Coverage:** 
The model has not been evaluated across broader domains such as code generation or web interaction, so its generalization beyond the studied reasoning tasks remains unverified.

## Summary
**Nemotron Orchestrator 8B** is a state-of-the-art 8B parameter orchestration model designed for complex, multi-turn agentic tasks.
- It coordinates multiple expert models and tools to solve problems efficiently.
- On the Humanity’s Last Exam benchmark, it outperforms GPT-5 while being approximately 2.5× more efficient.
- The model delivers higher accuracy at lower computational cost than monolithic frontier models.
- It is intended for research and development use only.
