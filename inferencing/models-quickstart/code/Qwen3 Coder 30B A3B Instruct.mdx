This will produce a response similar to the one below:
```plain theme={null}
Here are several Python implementations of the Fibonacci sequence calculation:

## 1. Basic Recursive Approach (Simple but Inefficient)

def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)

## 2. Iterative Approach (Efficient)

def fibonacci_iterative(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b

## Recommended Approach:
For most practical purposes, use the iterative approach because it's:
- Fast (O(n) time complexity)
- Memory efficient (O(1) space complexity)
- Easy to understand and implement
```

## Model Overview

Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B is a large causal language model designed for code generation and technical reasoning. It belongs to the latest generation of the Qwen model family and supports both thinking mode for complex reasoning and non-thinking mode for efficient general usage within the same model.

The model is built using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, activating only a subset of parameters per request to balance performance and efficiency. It is trained through both pretraining and post-training stages and supports long context lengths for complex coding and reasoning workflows.

- You want a model that can switch between deep reasoning and efficient responses
- Your workflow includes agent-based tasks with external tools
- You require multilingual support for technical or coding tasks

### Inference Parameters
| Parameter Name | Type    | Default | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Streaming      | boolean | true    | Enable streaming responses for real-time output.                            |
| Temperature    | number  | 0.7     | Controls randomness; higher values produce more diverse, less deterministic output. |
| Max Tokens     | number  | 65536   | Maximum tokens to generate in the response, suitable for long-form code or large refactors. |
| Top P          | number  | 0.8     | Nucleus sampling controlling token sampling diversity.                      |

### Key Features

- Supports thinking mode for complex reasoning, mathematics, and coding
- Supports non-thinking mode for efficient general-purpose dialogue
- Strong performance in code generation, technical reasoning, and logical tasks
- Designed for agent workflows with tool integration
- Supports multilingual instruction following and translation

## Best Practices

### Sampling Settings

#### Thinking Mode 
(`enable_thinking = true`) :
- **Temperature:** `0.6`  
- **Top-P:** `0.95`  
- **Top-K:** `20`  
- **Min-P:** `0`  
> Avoid greedy decoding to prevent repetition and degraded performance.

#### Non-Thinking Mode 
(`enable_thinking = false`) :
- **Temperature:** `0.7`    
- **Top-P:** `0.8`  
- **Top-K:** `20`  
- **Min-P:** `0`  
---
### Output Length
- **Recommended output length:** `32,768` tokens  
- **For highly complex math or programming problems:** `38,912` tokens  
---
### Prompt Standardization
#### Math Problems
Include the following instruction:
```text
Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.
```
**Multi-Turn Conversations**
- Historical responses should include only the final output
- Thinking content should not be stored in conversation history
- This behavior is handled automatically in the provided Jinja2 chat template

### Summary
**Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B** is a Mixture-of-Experts language model. It is optimized for code generation and technical reasoning tasks. The model supports both thinking and non-thinking modes in a single deployment. It provides long context support up to 131K tokens with YaRN. Designed for efficient, multilingual, and agent-based inferencing workflows.
