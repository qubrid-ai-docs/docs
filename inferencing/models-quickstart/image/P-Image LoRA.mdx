## About the Provider
Pruna AI is an AI optimization company focused on making state-of-the-art image generation fast, affordable, and accessible. Their P-Image model family is designed to deliver professional-quality image generation with sub-second inference speeds, strong prompt adherence, and support for fine-tuning and LoRA-based customization.

## Model Quickstart

This section helps you quickly get started with the `p-image-lora` model on the Qubrid AI inferencing platform.

To use this model, you need:

- A valid **Qubrid API key**
- Access to the Qubrid inference API
- Basic knowledge of making API requests in your preferred language

Once authenticated with your API key, you can send inference requests to the `p-image-lora` model and receive responses based on your input prompts.

Below are example placeholders showing how the model can be accessed using different programming environments.  
You can choose the one that best fits your workflow.

## Model Overview

**P-Image LoRA** is a variant of the P-Image model developed by Pruna AI, extending the base model with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) support for fine-tuned style control.  
- It enables custom LoRA weights to be applied at inference time, allowing domain-specific visual style adaptation without full model retraining.  
- The model supports optional prompt upsampling for enhanced prompt interpretation and more detailed image outputs.  
- P-Image LoRA is suitable for production workflows requiring both speed and style customization through lightweight fine-tuning.
