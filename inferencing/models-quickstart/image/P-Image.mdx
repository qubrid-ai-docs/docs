## About the Provider
Pruna AI is an AI optimization company focused on making state-of-the-art image generation fast, affordable, and accessible. Their P-Image model family is designed to deliver professional-quality image generation with sub-second inference speeds, strong prompt adherence, and support for fine-tuning and LoRA-based customization.
 
## Model Quickstart
 
This section helps you quickly get started with the `p-image` model on the Qubrid AI inferencing platform.
 
To use this model, you need:
 
- A valid **Qubrid API key**
- Access to the Qubrid inference API
- Basic knowledge of making API requests in your preferred language
 
Once authenticated with your API key, you can send inference requests to the `p-image` model and receive responses based on your input prompts.
 
Below are example placeholders showing how the model can be accessed using different programming environments.  
You can choose the one that best fits your workflow.
