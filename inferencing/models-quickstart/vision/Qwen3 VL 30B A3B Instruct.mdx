## Model Overview
**Qwen3 VL 30B A3B Instruct** is a large-scale vision-language model designed to process and reason over both text and visual inputs. It combines strong text understanding with advanced visual perception, spatial reasoning, OCR, and video comprehension. The model supports long-context workloads and agent-style interactions, enabling it to operate GUIs, invoke tools, and complete multimodal tasks. It is provided in a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and optimized for inference across edge-to-cloud environments. This Instruct variant is intended for instruction-following and multimodal interaction.

Judges object positions, viewpoints, occlusions, and supports stronger 2D grounding with enabled 3D grounding for spatial reasoning.

- **Long Context and Video Understanding :**
Supports a native 256K context window, expandable up to 1M, enabling processing of books and hours-long videos with second-level indexing.

- **Multimodal Reasoning :**
Combines visual and textual reasoning for causal analysis, logical problem-solving, and evidence-based responses, including STEM and math tasks.

- **Expanded OCR and Visual Recognition :**
Supports OCR across 32 languages and improves recognition under low light, blur, tilt, rare characters, and long-document structures.

### Summary
**Qwen3 VL 30B A3B Instruct** is a Mixture-of-Experts vision-language model designed for multimodal inference. 
- It processes text, images, and long-context inputs in a unified manner. The model supports visual reasoning, OCR, video understanding, and tool usage.
- It enables agent-style interactions such as GUI operation and task completion. Serverless inference is supported, while fine-tuning is not.
